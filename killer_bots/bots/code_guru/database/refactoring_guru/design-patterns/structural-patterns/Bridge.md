## Problem

_Abstraction?_ _Implementation?_ Sound scary? Stay calm and let’s consider a simple example.

Say you have a geometric `Shape` class with a pair of subclasses: `Circle` and `Square`. You want to extend this class hierarchy to incorporate colors, so you plan to create `Red` and `Blue` shape subclasses. However, since you already have two subclasses, you’ll need to create four class combinations such as `BlueCircle` and `RedSquare`.

![Bridge pattern problem](https://refactoring.guru/images/patterns/diagrams/bridge/problem-en.png)

Number of class combinations grows in geometric progression.

Adding new shape types and colors to the hierarchy will grow it exponentially. For example, to add a triangle shape you’d need to introduce two subclasses, one for each color. And after that, adding a new color would require creating three subclasses, one for each shape type. The further we go, the worse it becomes.

## Solution

This problem occurs because we’re trying to extend the shape classes in two independent dimensions: by form and by color. That’s a very common issue with class inheritance.

The Bridge pattern attempts to solve this problem by switching from inheritance to the object composition. What this means is that you extract one of the dimensions into a separate class hierarchy, so that the original classes will reference an object of the new hierarchy, instead of having all of its state and behaviors within one class.

![Solution suggested by the Bridge pattern](https://refactoring.guru/images/patterns/diagrams/bridge/solution-en.png)

You can prevent the explosion of a class hierarchy by transforming it into several related hierarchies.

Following this approach, we can extract the color-related code into its own class with two subclasses: `Red` and `Blue`. The `Shape` class then gets a reference field pointing to one of the color objects. Now the shape can delegate any color-related work to the linked color object. That reference will act as a bridge between the `Shape` and `Color` classes. From now on, adding new colors won’t require changing the shape hierarchy, and vice versa.

#### Abstraction and Implementation

The GoF book  introduces the terms _Abstraction_ and _Implementation_ as part of the Bridge definition. In my opinion, the terms sound too academic and make the pattern seem more complicated than it really is. Having read the simple example with shapes and colors, let’s decipher the meaning behind the GoF book’s scary words.

_Abstraction_ (also called _interface_) is a high-level control layer for some entity. This layer isn’t supposed to do any real work on its own. It should delegate the work to the _implementation_ layer (also called _platform_).

Note that we’re not talking about _interfaces_ or _abstract classes_ from your programming language. These aren’t the same things.

When talking about real applications, the abstraction can be represented by a graphical user interface (GUI), and the implementation could be the underlying operating system code (API) which the GUI layer calls in response to user interactions.

Generally speaking, you can extend such an app in two independent directions:

-   Have several different GUIs (for instance, tailored for regular customers or admins).
-   Support several different APIs (for example, to be able to launch the app under Windows, Linux, and macOS).

In a worst-case scenario, this app might look like a giant spaghetti bowl, where hundreds of conditionals connect different types of GUI with various APIs all over the code.

![Managing changes is much easier in modular code](https://refactoring.guru/images/patterns/content/bridge/bridge-3-en.png)

Making even a simple change to a monolithic codebase is pretty hard because you must understand the _entire thing_ very well. Making changes to smaller, well-defined modules is much easier.

You can bring order to this chaos by extracting the code related to specific interface-platform combinations into separate classes. However, soon you’ll discover that there are _lots_ of these classes. The class hierarchy will grow exponentially because adding a new GUI or supporting a different API would require creating more and more classes.

Let’s try to solve this issue with the Bridge pattern. It suggests that we divide the classes into two hierarchies:

-   Abstraction: the GUI layer of the app.
-   Implementation: the operating systems’ APIs.

![Cross-platform architecture](https://refactoring.guru/images/patterns/content/bridge/bridge-2-en.png)

One of the ways to structure a cross-platform application.

The abstraction object controls the appearance of the app, delegating the actual work to the linked implementation object. Different implementations are interchangeable as long as they follow a common interface, enabling the same GUI to work under Windows and Linux.

As a result, you can change the GUI classes without touching the API-related classes. Moreover, adding support for another operating system only requires creating a subclass in the implementation hierarchy.

## Pseudocode

This example illustrates how the **Bridge** pattern can help divide the monolithic code of an app that manages devices and their remote controls. The `Device` classes act as the implementation, whereas the `Remote`s act as the abstraction.

![Structure of the Bridge pattern example](https://refactoring.guru/images/patterns/diagrams/bridge/example-en.png)

The original class hierarchy is divided into two parts: devices and remote controls.

The base remote control class declares a reference field that links it with a device object. All remotes work with the devices via the general device interface, which lets the same remote support multiple device types.

You can develop the remote control classes independently from the device classes. All that’s needed is to create a new remote subclass. For example, a basic remote control might only have two buttons, but you could extend it with additional features, such as an extra battery or a touchscreen.

The client code links the desired type of remote control with a specific device object via the remote’s constructor.

```
// The "abstraction" defines the interface for the "control"
// part of the two class hierarchies. It maintains a reference
// to an object of the "implementation" hierarchy and delegates
// all of the real work to this object.
class RemoteControl is
    protected field device: Device
    constructor RemoteControl(device: Device) is
        this.device = device
    method togglePower() is
        if (device.isEnabled()) then
            device.disable()
        else
            device.enable()
    method volumeDown() is
        device.setVolume(device.getVolume() - 10)
    method volumeUp() is
        device.setVolume(device.getVolume() + 10)
    method channelDown() is
        device.setChannel(device.getChannel() - 1)
    method channelUp() is
        device.setChannel(device.getChannel() + 1)


// You can extend classes from the abstraction hierarchy
// independently from device classes.
class AdvancedRemoteControl extends RemoteControl is
    method mute() is
        device.setVolume(0)


// The "implementation" interface declares methods common to all
// concrete implementation classes. It doesn't have to match the
// abstraction's interface. In fact, the two interfaces can be
// entirely different. Typically the implementation interface
// provides only primitive operations, while the abstraction
// defines higher-level operations based on those primitives.
interface Device is
    method isEnabled()
    method enable()
    method disable()
    method getVolume()
    method setVolume(percent)
    method getChannel()
    method setChannel(channel)


// All devices follow the same interface.
class Tv implements Device is
    

class Radio implements Device is
    


// Somewhere in client code.
tv = new Tv()
remote = new RemoteControl(tv)
remote.togglePower()

radio = new Radio()
remote = new AdvancedRemoteControl(radio)
